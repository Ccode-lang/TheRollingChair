# The Rolling Chair
You walk into the facility after a tiring chase outside. Through the darkness of the facility, you see a chair. You don't think anything about it at the time, but as you explore, the chair seems to follow you. You feel it creep up behind you while you are in a corner, without you realizing you had stepped onto the chair. A noose wraps around your neck in your last moments.
